# wut
we love unix tools. but if you are living in window, you feel so limited and you'll miss your unix/linux workflow.

there are some ways to have unix tools in a windows machine. like Installing cygwin, wsl, msys..

But i don't like none of them. since they are not native and most of the time not efficient.

i like solutions that are simple and also let people to hack around things.

so because of that, i created wut. with no emulation, no illusion. real tools with real fucking win32 low-level api!
